# While Loop in Python
# In Python, a while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. 
# 
# count = 0
# while (count < 3):
#     count = count + 1
#     print("Hello World")

# Using else statement with While Loop in Python
# The else clause is only executed when your while condition becomes false. If you break out of the loop, or if an exception is raised, it wonâ€™t be executed. 

# count = 0
# while (count < 3):
#     count = count + 1
#     print("Hello World")
# else:
#     print("In Else Block")


# Infinite While Loop in Python
# If we want a block of code to execute infinite number of time, we can use the while loop in Python to do so.
# count = 0
# while (count == 0):
#     print("Hello World")
