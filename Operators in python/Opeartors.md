  mod: int = a % b
  ```

- `**` (Exponentiation): Raises the first number to the power of the second.  
  **Example**: Computing powers in scientific calculations, like finding 2Â³.
  ```python
  p: int = a ** b
  ```

---

### **2. Relational (Comparison) Operators**

These compare two values and return `True` or `False`.

- `>` (Greater than): Checks if the first value is greater than the second.  
  **Example**: Comparing age limits for driving.
  ```python
  a > b
  ```

- `<` (Less than): Checks if the first value is less than the second.  
  **Example**: Checking if a temperature is below freezing.
  ```python
  a < b
  ```

- `==` (Equal to): Checks if two values are equal.  
  **Example**: Verifying if a password matches a stored one.
  ```python
  a == b
  ```

- `!=` (Not equal to): Checks if two values are not equal.  
  **Example**: Validating if a selected item is not out of stock.
  ```python
  a != b
  ```

- `>=` (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the first value is greater than or equal to the second.  
  **Example**: Determining if someone qualifies for a discount based on age (e.g., 65+ for seniors).
  ```python
  a >= b
  ```

- `<=` (Less than or equal to): Checks if the first value is less than or equal to the second.  
  **Example**: Checking if a score meets the passing grade.
  ```python
  a <= b
  ```

---

### **3. Logical Operators**

Used to combine conditional statements.

- `and`: Returns `True` if both conditions are `True`.  
  **Example**: Checking if a user is both logged in and subscribed.
  ```python
  a and b
  ```

- `or`: Returns `True` if at least one condition is `True`.  
  **Example**: Checking if either one of two inputs is valid.
  ```python
  a or b
  ```

- `not`: Inverts the truth value.  
  **Example**: Checking if a user is not logged in.
  ```python
  not a
  ```

---

### **4. Bitwise Operators**

These work on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations.

- `&` (AND): Performs bitwise AND.  
  **Example**: Useful in low-level hardware programming for flags.
  ```python
  a & b
  ```

- `|` (OR): Performs bitwise OR.  
  **Example**: Used in networking and data transmission for combining flags.

  ```

---

### **5. Assignment Operators**

These assign values to variables with operations.

- `+=` (Addition assignment): Adds the right operand to the left and assigns the result.  
  **Example**: Adding points to a player's score.
  ```python
  b += a
  ```

- `-=` (Subtraction assignment): Subtracts the right operand from the left and assigns the result.  
  **Example**: Deducting the cost of a purchased item from the user's balance.

  **Example**: Checking if an item is available in the shopping list.
  ```python
  y in list1
  ```

- `not in`: Returns `True` if a value does not exist in the sequence.  
  **Example**: Validating if a username is not already taken in a list of users.
  ```python
  x not in list1
  ```

---

### **8. Ternary Operator**

This is a one-line shorthand for an if-else condition.

- `a if condition else b`: Returns `a` if the condition is `True`, otherwise returns `b`.  
  **Example**: Choosing the smaller of two numbers.
  ```python
  min = a if a < b else b
  ```

---

These operators are widely used in day-to-day coding tasks, from basic arithmetic to complex data processing, making them essential tools for Python programmers!


Bitwise operators work by directly manipulating the binary (bit) representation of integers. In Python, integers are stored in binary form (a series of 1s and 0s), and bitwise operators operate at the level of individual bits. Let's dive into how they work:

### **Binary Representation of Numbers**
Before we explain each bitwise operator, it's important to understand that all numbers are stored in binary, where each digit represents a power of 2.

For example:
- `5` in binary is `101` (4 + 1)
- `3` in binary is `011` (2 + 1)

---

### **1. Bitwise AND (`&`)**
- The **AND** operation compares each corresponding bit of two numbers. 
- If both bits are `1`, the result is `1`; otherwise, the result is `0`.

**Example**:  
```
a = 5       # binary: 101
b = 3       # binary: 011
result = a & b
```
**Step-by-step calculation**:
```
   101   (binary for 5)
&  011   (binary for 3)
-------
   001   (binary for 1)
```
Result: `1` (in decimal).

**Real-life use**: Bitwise AND is used to mask (extract) certain bits in data. For example, it can extract specific flags in a binary sequence.

---

### **2. Bitwise OR (`|`)**
- The **OR** operation compares each corresponding bit of two numbers. 
- If at least one of the bits is `1`, the result is `1`; otherwise, the result is `0`.

**Example**:  
```
a = 5       # binary: 101
b = 3       # binary: 011
result = a | b
```
**Step-by-step calculation**:
```
   101   (binary for 5)
|  011   (binary for 3)
-------
   111   (binary for 7)
```
Result: `7` (in decimal).

**Real-life use**: Bitwise OR is used when you want to set certain bits. For example, it can be used to combine settings or features in flags.

---

### **3. Bitwise NOT (`~`)**
- The **NOT** operation flips all the bits. 
- `1` becomes `0`, and `0` becomes `1`.

**Example**:  
```
a = 5       # binary: 101
result = ~a
```
**Step-by-step calculation**:
```
~ 101   (binary for 5)
-------
  010   (in binary, but actually -6 in two's complement)
```
Result: `-6` (in decimal). 

**Explanation**: In Python, `~a` gives `-(a + 1)`. So, `~5` becomes `-(5 + 1) = -6`.

**Real-life use**: Bitwise NOT is used to invert all bits, which is often useful in low-level operations or dealing with two's complement numbers in negative representation.

---

### **4. Bitwise XOR (`^`)**
- The **XOR** operation compares each corresponding bit of two numbers.
- If the bits are different (one is `1` and the other is `0`), the result is `1`. If they are the same (both `1` or both `0`), the result is `0`.

**Example**:  
```
a = 5       # binary: 101
b = 3       # binary: 011
result = a ^ b
```
**Step-by-step calculation**:
```
   101   (binary for 5)
^  011   (binary for 3)
-------
   110   (binary for 6)
```
Result: `6` (in decimal).

**Real-life use**: XOR is often used in encryption algorithms and error detection. It's also useful for toggling specific bits.

---

### **5. Left Shift (`<<`)**
- The **left shift** operation shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions. 
- Each left shift multiplies the number by 2.

**Example**:  
```
a = 5       # binary: 101
result = a << 1
```
**Step-by-step calculation**:
```
   101   (binary for 5)
<< 1
-------
  1010   (binary for 10)
```
Result: `10` (in decimal).

**Real-life use**: Left shifts are used for efficient multiplication by powers of 2. It's often used in graphics programming and embedded systems.

---

### **6. Right Shift (`>>`)**
- The **right shift** operation shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions.
- Each right shift divides the number by 2 (discarding any remainder).

**Example**:  
```
a = 5       # binary: 101
result = a >> 1
```
**Step-by-step calculation**:
```
   101   (binary for 5)
>> 1
-------
    10   (binary for 2)
```
Result: `2` (in decimal).

**Real-life use**: Right shifts are used for efficient division by powers of 2. It's commonly used in cryptography and compression algorithms.

### Summary of Operations:
- **AND (`&`)**: Compares bits, resulting in `1` if both bits are `1`.
- **OR (`|`)**: Compares bits, resulting in `1` if at least one bit is `1`.
- **NOT (`~`)**: Inverts the bits.
- **XOR (`^`)**: Compares bits, resulting in `1` if bits are different.
- **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Shifts bits left, multiplying by 2.
- **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Shifts bits right, dividing by 2.

These operations are essential in fields like cryptography, networking, graphics, and hardware interfacing, where bit-level manipulation is crucial.
