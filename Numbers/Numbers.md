# Python Integer
## Python int is the whole number, including negative numbers but not fractions. In Python, there is no limit to how long an integer value can be.

## Example 1: Creating int and checking type


```python
num = -8

# print the data type 
print(type(num))
```

# Python Float
## Some examples of numbers that are represented as floats are 0.5 and -7.823457.
### Example 1: Creating float and checking type


```python
num = 3/4

# print the data type
print(type(num))
```
# Python Complex
## A complex number is a number that consists of real and imaginary parts. For example, 2 + 3j is a complex number where 2 is the real component, and 3 multiplied by j is an imaginary part.
### Example 1: Creating Complex and checking type


```python
num = 6 + 9j

print(type(num))
```
